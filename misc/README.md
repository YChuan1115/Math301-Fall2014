### Some Online Resources
+ [A list of mathematical structures](http://www.math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php/index.html).  
+ Some relevant Wikipedia pages:  
  + [Algebraic structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure)  
  **Examples: Group-like structures**  
    + [Magma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)) or groupoid: a set S and a
      single binary operation defined on S.  
	+ [Semigroup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup) an associative magma.  
	+ [Semilattice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice) a semigroup whose
      operation is idempotent and commutative. (The binary operation can be
      called either meet or join.)  
	+ [Monoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) a semigroup with identity.  
    + [Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) a monoid with a
      unary inverse operation (giving rise to inverse elements).  
    + [Abelian group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group) a group whose
      binary operation is commutative.  
	+ [Quasigroup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasigroup) a magma obeying the
	  latin square property. A quasigroup may also be represented using three
	  binary operations.
