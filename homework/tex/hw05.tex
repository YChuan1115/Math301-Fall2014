\begin{enumerate}

%% 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 6.}]
Find the order of every element in the symmetry group of the square,
$D_4$.

\medskip 

%% 12 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 12.}]
Find a cyclic group with exactly one generator.  Can you find cyclic
groups with exactly two generators?  Four generators?  How about $n$
generators?

\medskip 

%% 13 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 13.}]
For $n \leq 20$, which groups $U(n)$ are cyclic?  Make a conjecture as
to what is true in general.  Can you prove your conjecture?  

%% 28 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 28.}]
Let $a$ be an element in a group $G$. What is a generator for the
subgroup $\langle a^m \rangle  \cap  \langle a^n \rangle $?
 

%% 30 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 30.}]
Suppose that $G$ is a group and let $a$, $b \in G$. Prove that if $|a|
= m$ and $|b| = n$ with $\gcd(m,n) = 1$, then $\langle a \rangle  \cap
\langle b \rangle  = \{ e \}$. 
 
%% 35 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 35.}]
Prove that the subgroups of ${\mathbb Z}$ are exactly $n{\mathbb Z}$ for $n
= 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. 


%% 38 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 38.}]
Prove that the order of an element in a cyclic group $G$ must divide
the order of the  group.
