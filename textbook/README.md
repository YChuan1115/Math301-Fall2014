# Math 301: Fall 2014 -- Textbook

The file
[Math301F14_textbook.pdf](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/blob/master/textbook/Math301F14_textbook.pdf?raw=true)
in this directory is the textbook for William DeMeo's Math 301 class
(Section B). 
It was created from the LaTeX source code in the judson-aata-altrev subdirectory. 

## What is different about this version

1. It has "hyperrefs" enabled, which means that the cross-references are colored
blue indicating that they are hyperlinks and, when clicked, they will bring you
to the page containing the referenced item. 

2. Some typos have been fixed.  For a full list of edits, check the
   [commit history log](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/commits/master/textbook/judson-aata-altrev)
