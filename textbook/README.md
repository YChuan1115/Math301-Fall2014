# Math 301 -- Fall 2014 -- Section B: Textbook

The file aata.pdf in this directory is a version of our textbook that I created
from the source code residing in the judson-aata-altrev subdirectory.

## What is different about this version.

1. It has "hyperrefs" enabled, which means that the cross-references are colored
blue indicating that they are hyperlinks and, when clicked, they will bring you
to the page containing the referenced item. 

2. Some typos have been fixed.  For a full list of edits, check the
   [commit history log](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/commits/master/textbook/judson-aata-altrev)

I will evaluate your changes and consider them for inclusion in our version of
the textbook. (I will consider awarding extra credit points for accepted pull
