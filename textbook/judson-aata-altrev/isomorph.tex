\chap{Isomorphisms}{isomorph}

Many groups may appear to be different at first glance, but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements.  For example, ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and  the subgroup of the circle group ${\mathbb T}$ generated by $i$ can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations. In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.  


\section{Definition and Examples}\label{isomorph_section_1}

Two groups $(G, \cdot)$ and $(H, \circ)$ are \boldemph{isomorphic}\index{Group!isomorphic} if there exists a one-to-one and onto map $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ such that the group operation is preserved;  that~is, 
\[
\phi( a \cdot b) = \phi( a) \circ \phi( b)
\]
for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$. If $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, we write $G \cong H$\label{noteisomorph}. The map $\phi$ is called an \boldemph{isomorphism}\index{Group!isomorphism of}\index{Isomorphism!of groups}. 

\begin{example}{Z4_isomorph}
To show that ${\mathbb Z}_4 \cong \langle i \rangle$, define a map $\phi: {\mathbb Z}_4 \rightarrow \langle i \rangle$ by $\phi(n) = i^n$.  We must show that $\phi$ is bijective and preserves the group operation.  The map $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto because
\begin{align*}
\phi(0) & = 1 \\
\phi(1) & = i \\
\phi(2) & = -1 \\
\phi(3) & = -i.
\end{align*}
Since
\[
\phi(m + n) = i^{m+n} = i^m i^n = \phi(m) \phi( n),
\]
the group operation is preserved.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{RealIsomorph}
We can define an isomorphism $\phi$ from the additive group of real numbers $( {\mathbb R}, + )$ to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers  $( {\mathbb R^+}, \cdot )$  with the exponential map; that is,
\[
\phi( x + y) = e^{x + y} = e^x e^y = \phi( x ) \phi( y).
\]
Of course, we must still show that $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto, but this can be determined using calculus. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}{rational_isomorph}
The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of ${\mathbb Q}^\ast$ consisting of elements of the form $2^n$.  Define a map $\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Q}^\ast$ by $\phi( n ) = 2^n$. Then
\[
\phi( m + n ) = 2^{m + n} = 2^m 2^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n ).
\]
By definition the map $\phi$ is onto the subset $\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}$ of  ${\mathbb Q}^\ast$.  To show that the map is injective, assume that $m \neq n$.  If we can show that $\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)$, then we are done.  Suppose that $m > n$ and assume that $\phi(m) = \phi(n)$.  Then $2^m = 2^n$ or $2^{m-n} = 1$, which is impossible since $m-n > 0$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}{units}
The groups ${\mathbb Z}_8$ and ${\mathbb Z}_{12}$  cannot be isomorphic since they have different orders; however, it is true that $U(8) \cong U(12)$.  We know that
\begin{align*}
U(8) & = \{1, 3, 5, 7 \} \\
U(12) & = \{1, 5, 7, 11 \}.
\end{align*}
An isomorphism $\phi : U(8) \rightarrow U(12)$ is then given by
\begin{align*}
1 & \mapsto  1 \\
3 & \mapsto  5 \\
5 & \mapsto  7 \\
7 & \mapsto  11.
\end{align*}
The map $\phi$ is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups.  We could define another isomorphism $\psi$ by $\psi(1) = 1$, $\psi(3) = 11$, $\psi(5) = 5$, $\psi(7) = 7$. In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ (see Example~\ref{example:groups:Z2xZ2} in Chapter~\ref{groups}). 
\end{example}

\begin{example}{not_isomorph}
Even though $S_3$ and ${\mathbb Z}_6$ possess the same number of elements, we would suspect that they are not isomorphic, because ${\mathbb Z}_6$ is abelian and $S_3$ is nonabelian.  To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, suppose that $\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  S_3$ is an isomorphism.  Let $a , b \in S_3$ be two elements such that $ab \neq ba$.  Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism, there exist elements $m$ and $n$ in ${\mathbb Z}_6$ such~that 
\[
\phi( m )  = a \quad \text{and} \quad
\phi( n )  = b.
\]
However,
\[
ab = \phi(m ) \phi(n) = \phi(m + n) = \phi(n + m) = \phi(n )
\phi(m) = ba,
\]
which contradicts the fact that $a$ and $b$ do not commute.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph_theorem_1}
Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism of two groups.  Then the following statements are true. 
\begin{enumerate}
 
\rm \item \it
$\phi^{-1} : H \rightarrow G$ is an isomorphism. 

\rm \item \it
$|G| = |H|$. 

\rm \item \it
If $G$ is abelian, then $H$ is abelian. 

\rm \item \it
If $G$ is cyclic, then $H$ is cyclic. 

\rm \item \it
If $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$, then $H$ has a subgroup of order $n$.
 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assertions (1) and (2) follow from the fact that $\phi$ is a bijection.  We will prove (3) here and leave the remainder of the theorem to be proved in the exercises.
 
(3)
Suppose that $h_1$ and $h_2$ are elements of $H$.  Since $\phi$ is onto, there exist elements $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $\phi(g_1) = h_1$ and $\phi(g_2) = h_2$.  Therefore, 
\[
h_1 h_2 = \phi(g_1) \phi(g_2) =  \phi(g_1 g_2) = \phi(g_2 g_1) = \phi(g_2) \phi(g_1) = h_2 h_1. 
\]
\end{proof}

\medskip

We are now in a position to characterize all cyclic groups.

\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph_theorem_2}
All cyclic groups of infinite order are isomorphic to ${\mathbb Z}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group with infinite order and suppose that $a$ is a generator of $G$.  Define a map $\phi : {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow  G$ by $\phi : n \mapsto a^n$. Then 
\[
\phi( m+n ) = a^{m+n} = a^m a^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n ).
\]
To show that $\phi$ is injective, suppose that $m$ and $n$ are two elements in ${\mathbb Z}$, where $m \neq n$.  We can assume that $m > n$.  We must show that $a^m \neq a^n$. Let us suppose the contrary; that is, $a^m = a^n$. In this case $a^{m - n} = e$, where $m - n > 0$, which contradicts the fact that $a$ has infinite order.  Our map is onto since any element in $G$ can be written as $a^n$ for some integer $n$ and $\phi(n) = a^n$.   
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph_theorem_3}
If $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to~${\mathbb Z}_n$.  
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ generated by $a$ and define a map $\phi : {\mathbb Z}_n \rightarrow  G$ by $\phi : k \mapsto a^k$, where $0 \leq k < n$. The proof that $\phi$ is an isomorphism is one of the end-of-chapter exercises. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{isomorph_theorem_4}
If $G$ is a  group of order $p$, where $p$ is a prime number, then $G$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb Z}_p$. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The proof is a direct result of Corollary~\ref{cosets_theorem_7}.
\end{proof}
 
\medskip
 
The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups; however, it makes sense to consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.  We state this result in the following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise. 

\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph_theorem_5}
The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relation on the class of all groups. 
\end{theorem}
 
Hence, we can modify our goal of classifying all groups to classifying all groups \boldemph{up to isomorphism}; that is, we will consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.

 
\subsection*{Cayley's Theorem}

Cayley proved that if $G$ is a group, it is isomorphic to a group of permutations on some set; hence, every group is a permutation group.  Cayley's Theorem is what  we call a representation theorem.  The aim of representation theory is to find an isomorphism of some group $G$ that we wish to study into a group that we know a great deal about, such as a group of permutations or matrices.

\begin{example}{cayley_isomorph}
Consider the group ${\mathbb Z}_3$.  The Cayley table for ${\mathbb Z}_3$ is as follows. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
$+$   & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
0     & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
1     & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
2     & 2 & 0 & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The addition table of ${\mathbb Z}_3$ suggests that it is the same as the permutation group $G = \{ (0), (0 1 2), (0 2 1) \}$.  The isomorphism here is 
\begin{align*}
0 & \mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
= (0) \\
1 & \mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
= (0 1 2) \\
2 & \mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
= (0 2 1).
\end{align*}
\end{example}
 
\begin{theorem}[Cayley]\label{isomorph_theorem_6}\index{Cayley's Theorem}
Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a group.  We must find a group of permutations $\overline{G}$ that is isomorphic to $G$.  For any $g \in G$, define a  function $\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G$ by $\lambda_g(a) = ga$.  We claim that $\lambda_g$ is a permutation of $G$.  To show that $\lambda_g$ is one-to-one, suppose that $\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b)$.  Then  
\[
ga =\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b) = gb.
\]
Hence, $a = b$.  To show that $\lambda_g$ is onto, we must prove that for each $a \in G$, there is a $b$ such that $\lambda_g (b) = a$.  Let $b = g^{-1} a$.  

Now we are ready to define our group $\overline{G}$. Let
\[
\overline{G} = \{ \lambda_g : g \in G \}.
\]
We must show that $\overline{G}$ is a group under composition of functions and find an isomorphism between $G$ and $\overline{G}$.  We have closure under composition of functions since 
\[
(\lambda_g \circ \lambda_h )(a) = \lambda_g(ha) = gha = \lambda_{gh} (a).
\]
Also,
\[
\lambda_e (a) = ea = a
\]
and
\[
(\lambda_{g^{-1}} \circ \lambda_g) (a) = \lambda_{g^{-1}} (ga) = g^{-1} g a = a = \lambda_e (a).
\]

We can define an isomorphism from $G$ to $\overline{G}$ by $\phi : g
\mapsto \lambda_g$. The group operation is preserved since
\[
\phi(gh) = \lambda_{gh} = \lambda_g \lambda_h = \phi(g) \phi(h).
\]
It is also one-to-one, because if $\phi(g)(a) = \phi(h)(a)$, then
\[
ga = \lambda_g a = \lambda_h a=  ha.
\]
Hence, $g = h$.  That $\phi$ is onto follows from the fact that $\phi( g ) = \lambda_g$ for any $\lambda_g \in \overline{G}$. 
\end{proof}

\medskip

The isomorphism $g \mapsto \lambda_g$ is known as the \boldemph{left regular representation}\index{Left regular representation} of~$G$.

\section{Direct Products}\label{isomorph_section_2}

Given two groups $G$ and $H$, it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian product of $G$ and $H$, $G \times H$.  Conversely, given a large group, it is sometimes possible to decompose the group; that is, a group is sometimes isomorphic to the direct product of two smaller groups.  Rather than studying a large group $G$, it is often easier to study the component groups of $G$. 
 
 
\subsection*{External Direct Products}

If $(G,\cdot)$ and $(H, \circ)$ are groups, then we can make the Cartesian product of $G$ and $H$ into a new group.  As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs $(g, h) \in G \times H$ where $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. We can define a binary operation on $G \times H$ by 
\[
(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1 \cdot g_2, h_1 \circ h_2);
\]
that is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in $G$ and elements in the second coordinate as we do in $H$.  We have specified the particular operations $\cdot$ and $\circ$ in each group here for the sake of clarity; we usually just write $(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1  g_2, h_1 h_2)$.  

\begin{proposition}\label{isomorph_theorem_7}
Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. The set $G \times H$ is a group under the operation $(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1  g_2, h_1 h_2)$ where $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $h_1, h_2 \in H$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Clearly the binary operation defined above is closed. If $e_G$ and $e_H$ are the identities of the groups $G$ and $H$ respectively, then $(e_G, e_H)$ is the identity of $G \times H$.  The inverse of $(g, h) \in G \times H$ is $(g^{-1}, h^{-1})$.  The fact that the operation is associative follows directly from the associativity of $G$ and~$H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}{R2_prodiuct}
Let ${\mathbb R}$ be the group of real numbers under addition.  The Cartesian product of ${\mathbb R}$ with itself, ${\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R} = {\mathbb R}^2$, is also a group, in which the group operation is just addition in each coordinate; that is, $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$.  The identity is $(0,0)$ and the inverse of $(a, b)$ is $(-a, -b)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Z2xZ2}
Consider
\[
{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2 = \{ (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0),(1, 1) \}.
\]
Although ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ and ${\mathbb Z}_4$ both contain four elements, it is easy to see that they are not isomorphic since for every element $(a,b)$ in ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$, $(a,b) + (a,b) = (0,0)$, but ${\mathbb Z}_4$ is cyclic.
\end{example}

The group $G \times H$ is called the \boldemph{external direct product}\index{Direct product of groups!external}\index{External direct product} of  $G$ and $H$. Notice that there is nothing special about the fact that we have used only two groups to build a new group. The direct product
\[
\prod_{i = 1}^n G_i = G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots \times G_n
\]
of the groups $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$ is defined in exactly the same manner. If $G = G_1 = G_2 = \cdots = G_n$, we often write $G^n$ instead of $G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots \times G_n$.
 
\begin{example}{Z2^n}
The group ${\mathbb Z}_2^n$, considered as a set, is just the set of all
binary $n$-tuples. The group operation is the ``exclusive or'' of two
binary $n$-tuples. For example, 
\[
(01011101) + (01001011) = (00010110).
\]
This group is important in coding theory, in cryptography, and in many
areas of computer science.  
\end{example}

 
\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph:lcm_theorem}
Let $(g, h) \in G \times H$. If $g$ and $h$ have finite orders $r$ and
$s$ respectively, then the order of $(g, h)$ in $G \times H$ is the
least common multiple of $r$ and $s$. 
\end{theorem}

 
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $m$ is the least common multiple of $r$ and $s$ and let
$n = |(g,h)|$. Then 
\begin{gather*}
(g,h)^m  = (g^m, h^m) = (e_G,e_H) \\
(g^n, h^n)  = (g, h)^n = (e_G,e_H).
\end{gather*}
Hence, $n$ must divide $m$, and $n \leq m$.  However, by the second
equation, both $r$ and $s$ must divide $n$; therefore, $n$ is a common
multiple of $r$ and $s$. Since $m$ is the \emph{least common multiple}
of $r$ and $s$, $m \leq n$.  Consequently, $m$ must be equal to~$n$.
\end{proof}
 

\begin{corollary}
Let $(g_1, \ldots, g_n) \in \prod G_i$. If $g_i$ has finite order
$r_i$ in $G_i$, then the order of $(g_1, \ldots, g_n)$ in $\prod G_i$
is the least common multiple of $r_1, \ldots, r_n$.
\end{corollary}
 
 
\begin{example}{Z12xZ60}
Let $(8, 56) \in {\mathbb Z}_{12} \times  {\mathbb Z}_{60}$. Since
$\gcd(8,12) = 4$, the order of 8 is $12/4 = 3$ in ${\mathbb Z}_{12}$.
Similarly, the order of $56$ in ${\mathbb Z}_{60}$ is $15$. The least
common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15; hence, $(8, 56)$ has order 15 in
${\mathbb Z}_{12} \times  {\mathbb Z}_{60}$.
\end{example}

 
\begin{example}{Z2xZ3}
The group ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_3$ consists of the pairs
\[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
(0,0),& (0, 1),& (0, 2),& (1,0),& (1, 1),& (1, 2).
\end{array}
\]
In this case, unlike that of ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ and
${\mathbb Z}_4$, it 
is true that ${\mathbb Z}_2  \times {\mathbb Z}_3 \cong {\mathbb Z}_6$. We need
only show that ${\mathbb Z}_2  \times {\mathbb Z}_3$ is cyclic.  It is
easy to see that $(1,1)$ is a generator for ${\mathbb Z}_2  \times {\mathbb
Z}_3$. 
\end{example}

 
The next theorem tells us exactly when the direct product of two
cyclic groups is cyclic. 
 

\begin{theorem}\label{Z_pq_theorem}
The group ${\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb
Z}_{mn}$ if and only if $\gcd(m,n)=1$. 
\end{theorem}
 

\begin{proof}
Assume first that if ${\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n \cong {\mathbb
Z}_{mn}$, then $\gcd(m, n) = 1$. To show this, we will prove the
contrapositive; that is, we will show that if $\gcd(m, n) = d >
1$, then ${\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n$ cannot be cyclic. Notice that
$mn/d$ is divisible by both $m$ and $n$; hence, for any element $(a,b)
\in {\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n$,  
\[
\underbrace{(a,b) + (a,b)+ \cdots + (a,b)}_{mn/d \; {\rm
times}}
= (0, 0).
\]
Therefore, no $(a, b)$ can generate all of ${\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb
Z}_n$. 

 
The converse follows directly from Theorem~\ref{isomorph:lcm_theorem} since
$\lcm(m,n) = mn$ if and only if $\gcd(m,n)=1$. 
\end{proof}
 

\begin{corollary}\label{RelativelyPrime}
Let $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ be positive integers. Then
\[
\prod_{i=1}^k {\mathbb Z}_{n_i} \cong {\mathbb Z}_{n_1 \cdots n_k}
\]
if and only if $\gcd( n_i, n_j) =1$ for $i \neq j$.
\end{corollary}

 
\begin{corollary}
If
\[
m = p_1^{e_1} \cdots  p_k^{e_k},
\]
where the $p_i$s are distinct primes, then
\[
{\mathbb Z}_m \cong {\mathbb Z}_{p_1^{e_1}} \times \cdots \times {\mathbb
Z}_{p_k^{e_k}}.
\]
\end{corollary}
 
 
\begin{proof}
Since the greatest common divisor of $p_i^{e_i}$ and $p_j^{e_j}$ is
1 for $i \neq j$, the proof follows from Corollary~\ref{RelativelyPrime}.
\end{proof}


\medskip


In Chapter~\ref{struct}, we will prove that all finite abelian groups are %This reference needs to be fixed - TWJ 6/2/2010
isomorphic to direct products of
the form
\[
{\mathbb Z}_{p_1^{e_1}} \times \cdots \times {\mathbb
Z}_{p_k^{e_k}}
\]
where $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes.

 
 
\subsection*{Internal Direct Products}
 

The external direct product of two groups builds a large group out of
two smaller groups.   We would like to be able to reverse this process
and conveniently break down a group into its direct product
components; that is, we would like to be able to say when a group is
isomorphic to the direct product of two of its subgroups.
 

Let $G$ be a group with subgroups $H$ and $K$ satisfying the following
conditions.
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
$G = HK = \{ hk : h \in H, k \in K  \}$;
 
\item
$H \cap K = \{ e \}$;
 
\item
$hk = kh$ for all $k \in K$ and $h \in H$.
 
\end{itemize}
Then $G$ is the \boldemph{internal direct product}\index{Direct product of
groups!internal}\index{Internal direct product} of $H$ and $K$.

 
\begin{example}{U8}
The group $U(8)$ is the internal direct product of
\[
H  = \{1, 3 \} \quad \text{and} \quad K  = \{1, 5 \}.
\]
\end{example}

 
\begin{example}{D6_product}
The dihedral group $D_6$ is an internal direct product of its two
subgroups 
\[
H  = \{id, r^3  \} \quad \text{and} \quad
K  = \{id, r^2, r^4, s, r^2s, r^4 s   \}.
\]
It can easily be shown that $K \cong S_3$; consequently, $D_6 \cong
{\mathbb Z}_2 \times S_3$. 
\end{example}

 
\begin{example}{S3_not_a_product}
Not every group can be written as the internal direct product of two
of its proper subgroups.  If the group $S_3$ were an internal direct
product of its proper subgroups $H$ and $K$, then one of the  subgroups,
say $H$, would have to have order 3. In this case $H$ is the subgroup $\{
(1), (123), (132) \}$. The subgroup $K$ must have order 2, but no
matter which subgroup we choose for $K$, the condition that $hk = kh$
will never be satisfied for $h \in H$ and $k \in K$.
\mbox{\hspace{1in}}
\end{example}

 
\begin{theorem}\label{isomorph:directproducts}
Let $G$ be the internal direct product of  subgroups $H$ and $K$. Then
$G$ is isomorphic to $H \times K$. 
\end{theorem}
 

\begin{proof}
Since $G$ is an internal direct product, we can write any element $g
\in G$ as $g =hk$ for some $h \in H$ and some $k \in K$. Define a map
$\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K$ by $\phi(g) = (h,k)$.

 
The first problem that we must face is to show that $\phi$ is a
well-defined map; that is, we must show that $h$ and $k$ are uniquely
determined by $g$. Suppose that $g = hk=h'k'$. Then $h^{-1} h'= k
(k')^{-1}$ is in both $H$ and $K$, so it must be the identity.
Therefore, $h = h'$ and $k = k'$, which proves that $\phi$ is, indeed,
well-defined. 

 
To show that $\phi$ preserves the group operation, let $g_1 = h_1 k_1$
and $g_2 = h_2 k_2$ and observe that 
\begin{align*}
\phi( g_1 g_2 ) & = \phi( h_1 k_1 h_2 k_2 )\\
& = \phi(h_1  h_2 k_1 k_2) \\
& = (h_1  h_2, k_1 k_2) \\
& = (h_1, k_1)( h_2, k_2) \\
& = \phi( g_1 ) \phi(  g_2 ).
\end{align*}
We will leave the proof that $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto
as an exercise.
\end{proof}

 
\begin{example}{Z6_product}
The group ${\mathbb Z}_6$ is an internal direct product isomorphic to $\{
0, 2, 4\} \times \{ 0, 3 \}$. 
\end{example}

 
We can extend the definition of an internal direct product of $G$ to a
collection of subgroups $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n$ of $G$, by requiring
that 
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
$G = H_1 H_2 \cdots H_n = \{ h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n : h_i \in H_i \}$;
 
\item
$H_i \cap \langle \cup_{j \neq i} H_j \rangle = \{ e \}$;
 
\item
$h_i h_j = h_j h_i$ for all $h_i \in H_i$ and $h_j \in H_j$.
 
\end{itemize}
We will leave the proof of the following theorem as an exercise. 
 
\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be the internal direct product of subgroups $H_i$, where $i =
1, 2, \ldots, n$. Then $G$ is isomorphic to $\prod_i H_i$. 
\end{theorem}

\item %Exercise suggested by R. Beezer. - TWJ 8/30/2011
\textbf{Groups of order $2p$.}
In this series of exercises we will classify all groups of order $2p$, where $p$ is an odd prime.
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Assume $G$ is a group of order $2p$, where $p$ is an odd prime.  If $a \in G$, show that $A$ must have order 1, 2, $p$, or $2p$.


\item
Suppose that $G$ an element of order $2p$.  Prove that $G$ isomorphic to ${\mathbb Z}_{2p}$.  Hence, $G$ is cyclic.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$.  Show that $G$ must contain an element of order $p$.  \emph{Hint}:  Assume that $G$ does not contain an element of order $p$.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$.  Show that $G$ must contain an element of order 2. 



\item
Let $P$ be a subgroup of $G$ with order $p$ and $y \in G$ have order 2.  Show that $yP = Py$.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$ and $P = \langle z \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $p$ generated by $z$.  If $y$ is an element of order 2, then $yz = z^ky$ for some $2 \leq k < p$.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$.  Prove that $G$ is not abelian.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$ and $P = \langle z \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $p$ generated by $z$ and $y$ is an element of order 2.
Show that we can list the elements of $G$ as $\{z^iy^j\mid 0\leq i < p, 0\leq j < 2\}$.



\item
Suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $2p$ and $P = \langle z \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $p$ generated by $z$ and $y$ is an element of order 2.  Prove that the product
$(z^iy^j)(z^ry^s)$ can be expressed as a uniquely as $z^m y^n$ for some non negative integers $m, n$.  Thus, conclude that there is only one possibility for a non-abelian group of order $2p$, it must therefore be the one we have seen already, the dihedral group.
