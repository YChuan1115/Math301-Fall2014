Sage supports distinctions between ``plain'' rings, domains, principal ideal domains and fields.  Support is often very good for constructions and computations with PID's, but sometimes problems get significantly harder (computationally) when a ring has less structure that that of a PID.  So be aware when using Sage that some questions may go unanswered for rings with less structure.
