Sage is free, open source, mathematical software, which has very impressive capabilities for the study of abstract algebra.  See the Preface for more information about obtaining Sage and the supplementary material describing how to use Sage in the study of abstract algebra.  At the end of chapter, we will have a brief explanation of Sage's capabilities relevant to that chapter.
