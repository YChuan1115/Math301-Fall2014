Math 301, Fall 2014: Sage Information
-------------------------------------

This directory contains some information about Sage, as well as some
Sage worksheets (files that can be loaded into Sage).

The file [aata-20140815-sage-6.3.pdf](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/blob/master/sage/aata-20140815-sage-6.3.pdf?raw=true)
is a document that supplements our textbook with information about Sage that is
directly tied to the text.

The directory [aata-worksheets](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/tree/master/sage/aata-worksheets)
contains worksheets from the [supplementary document](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/blob/master/sage/aata-20140815-sage-6.3.pdf?raw=true) mentioned above.

**Important Note:** Unfortunately, older Sage worksheets
(usually with a .sws file extension), such as those in the aata-worksheets
directory, do not yet work with the cloud sage server at
[cloud.sagemath.com](http://cloud.sagemath.org/).

I belive work is in progress that will eventually make the cloud version of Sage
backward compatible with older worksheets, but for now you can only load the old
worksheets into a Sage instance running on your own local machine, or into a
Sage session running at [www.sagenb.org](http://www.sagenb.org). 

## Extra Credit Sage work for Math 301

Students are not required to use Sage or any other software for Math 301.
However, I believe Sage and other software, like Gap, can be an enormous aid to
our intuition when learning new things about groups and other algebraic
structures. Therefore, during the semester, I will occasionally make extra
credit assignments available that involve the use of Sage or Gap or the
Universal Algebra Calculator.  These optional assignments are described
below.


### Sage Assignment 1

1. (1/4) Sign up for a Sage account at [sagemath.org](http://www.sagemath.org).  

2. (1/4) Create a new project named "Math 301" and then create a Sage Worksheet
  within that project.  Name your worksheet "Eratosthenes" or "Ackermann" or
  "DivisionAlgorithm" (depending on which problem you plan to solve in the next part).

3. (1/2) In the worksheet you created above, solve one of the three programming
  exercises described on page 35 of our textbook (the "Programming Exercises" at
  the end of Chapter 2).

To get credit for this assignment, when you have finished, you must either send
me your .sagews file by email, or invite me to be a collaborator on your Math 301
project. You must also email me a few sentences describing your experience and
your first impressions of Sage.

**Notes on Sage Assignment 1**

The number in parentheses indicates the fraction of the percentage point that
each part is worth.

The following are some notes about each part of the assignment:

1. Go to [cloud.sagemath.org](http://cloud.sagemath.org/).

2. First create a new project by clicking the link that says "New
   Project."  Name the project "Math 301," then click the Math 301 link that
   appears.  Wait for your new project to load, then either click "New" or
   "Create or Import a File, Worksheet..." In the box where it says, "Name
   your file," enter the name "Eratosthenes" or "Ackermann" or
   "DivisionAlgorithm" (depending on which problem you plan to solve in the next
   part). Then, where it says "Select the type," choose "Sage Worksheet."

3. You are to solve one of the three problems described on
   [page 35 of our textbook](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/blob/master/homework/pdf/SageAssignment1.pdf).

There is plenty of online documentation for Sage. If you need help, please ask!
Also, you can find some nice examples of Sage programs that are specifically
related to our course at
